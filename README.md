Magic wand that casts five different spells.
It's not wildly unique, but I do think the decapitate spell has some flare to it 
Server script might technically be just shy of 200 lines when ignoring any formatting lines ...
Hoping the length of the local script can be considered to offset that given it is apart of the necessary code to make it work, and also has its own unique code rather than just being re-declarations of variables and firing remotes.

Thanks

Magic wand that casts five different spells.
It's not wildly unique, but I do think the decapitate spell has some flare to it 
Server script should be just over 200 lines when ignoring any formatting lines ...
If any issue then I would hope the length of the local script can be considered as well given it is apart of the necessary code to make it work across client/server, and also has its own unique code rather than just being re-declarations of variables and firing remotes.

Thanks
